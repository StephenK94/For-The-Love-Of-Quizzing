# For-The-Love-Of-Quizzing

Concept & Features:

My idea for this project was to create a fun and challenging quiz website with multiple categories in which users can test there knowledge. I wanted to keep the design simplistic as to not distract from the sites main purpose. I intentionally designed it to not show correct answers to incorrectly answered questions, to keep the challenge alive and encourage replayability. Features include a sidebar which is only accessible on smaller screen sizes. There is a feedback form on the index page for reviews and ideas from users as to help improve/make additions to the site. The quiz itself which consists of 20 questions per quiz and tells the user if they've answered correctly or incorrectly by turning the selected answer Green or Red accordingly as they go.
